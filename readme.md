# 🚀 Cursor Unlimited Tool Calls (CUTC)

**CUTC** is an ultra-minimalist tool designed for **Cursor IDE**, **Windsurf IDE**, or any other agent-based coding assistant that supports tool calls. It helps you get the **maximum value from your monthly tool call allowance** by running your tasks in a loop with user input—without restarting the chat every time.

> **Important Note:** This only works with **Agent Mode** (Cursor) or **Cascade Mode** (Windsurf)

## 🔄 Fork and Improvements

This project is an improved fork of the original [10x-Tool-Calls](https://github.com/perrypixel/10x-Tool-Calls) by [@perrypixel](https://github.com/perrypixel). 

**Huge thanks to perrypixel for the pioneering work!** 🙏

### 🎯 What we've improved:

- **Developer-friendly structure**: Organized `src/` directory with transparent source files
- **Dual IDE support**: Works with both Cursor and Windsurf
- **Smart auto-detection**: Automatically detects your IDE setup
- **Flexible configuration**: Choose between auto-apply rules or context-only usage
- **DRY principle**: Single universal rules file for both IDEs
- **Enhanced error handling**: Smart troubleshooting and recovery
- **Cross-platform support**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

### ✨ New Features: Image and File Context

CUTC now supports providing images and files as direct context in your prompts.

- **🖼️ Image Context**: Provide a path to an image (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.), and the agent will "see" it.
- **📄 File Context**: Provide a path to a text file, and the agent will read its content.

---

## ✅ What CUTC Does

- After the AI completes a task, it runs a small Python script that asks:

```
prompt (or file path): 
```

- You can type your next instruction, or provide a path to an image or text file.
- The AI uses that input to continue working
- This loop repeats until:
  - You manually stop it, or
  - The session reaches your **tool call limit**

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

Most AI coding tools (like Cursor and Windsurf) offer **500 monthly requests**, but each request can include **up to 25 tool calls**. Normally, even saying `"hi"` uses up a full request, wasting potential.

With **CUTC**:
- You start with one request
- Within that session, you can give **multiple follow-ups**
- All follow-ups run within the same request using available tool calls
- This means you get **10x (or more)** actual work done with the same quota

## ⚙️ Ultra-Simple Installation

### Basic Installation (Auto-Detection)

```bash
python install.py
```

The installer will:
- 🔍 **Auto-detect** your IDE (Cursor or Windsurf)
- 📋 **Prompt** you to choose if both are detected
- 🚀 **Install** everything automatically

### Advanced Installation Options

```bash
# Install specifically for Cursor IDE
python install.py --ide cursor

# Install specifically for Windsurf IDE  
python install.py --ide windsurf

# Install for both IDEs
python install.py --ide both

# Keep installer for debugging
python install.py --keep-installer

# Get help
python install.py --help
```

**That's literally it!** 🎉

The installer:
- ✅ Reads source files from the `src/` directory  
- ✅ Auto-detects your IDE or prompts for selection
- ✅ Creates the proper IDE-specific structure
- ✅ Installs `userinput.py` at your project root
- ✅ Installs identical rules with appropriate extension (`.mdc` for Cursor, `.md` for Windsurf)
- ✅ Validates all required files exist before installation
- ✅ Provides clear success/error messages
- ✅ Includes comprehensive troubleshooting

## 🧪 Project Structure

CUTC now includes a `src/` directory for better developer experience:

```
CUTC/
├── src/
│   ├── cutc_rules.mdc         # 📋 Universal rules template (for both IDEs)
│   └── userinput.py           # 📝 User input script
├── install.py                 # 🚀 Smart installer
└── README.md                  # 📖 Complete documentation
```

### 🎯 Why src/ Directory?

The new structure provides several benefits:

- **👀 Transparency**: Developers can easily inspect and modify the source files
- **🔧 Customization**: Edit rules or scripts before installation
- **🧪 Testing**: Test modifications without reinstalling
- **📚 Learning**: Understand exactly what gets installed
- **🔄 Version Control**: Track changes to individual components
- **♻️ DRY Principle**: Single rules file adapted for both IDEs (no duplication)

After installation, your project will have:

### For Cursor IDE:
```
your-project/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       └── cutc_rules.mdc     # 🤖 CUTC rules for Cursor
├── userinput.py               # 📝 User input script
└── [your existing files...]
```

### For Windsurf IDE:
```
your-project/
├── .windsurf/
│   └── rules/
│       └── cutc_rules.md      # 🌊 CUTC rules for Windsurf
├── userinput.py               # 📝 User input script
└── [your existing files...]
```

## ⚙️ Rule Configuration

After installation, CUTC rules are installed as **pure Markdown files**. You have two configuration options:

### 🔄 Option 1: Always Apply Rules (Recommended)
Add YAML frontmatter to make rules apply automatically to all chats:

**For Cursor (.cursor/rules/cutc_rules.mdc):**
```yaml
---
description: "CUTC - Enhanced with Image and File Context"
globs: "**/*"
alwaysApply: true
---

# CUTC - Enhanced with Image and File Context
# ... rest of the file content
```

**For Windsurf (.windsurf/rules/cutc_rules.md):**
```yaml
---
description: "CUTC - Enhanced with Image and File Context"
enabled: true
---

# CUTC - Enhanced with Image and File Context
# ... rest of the file content
```

### 🎯 Option 2: Use as Context Only
Keep the files as pure Markdown and reference them manually:
- **Cursor**: Use `@.cursor/rules/cutc_rules.mdc` in your chat
- **Windsurf**: Use `@.windsurf/rules/cutc_rules.md` in your chat

This approach gives you full control over when CUTC rules are applied.

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Only use this setup with tools that offer a tool call–based quota**, not token-based pricing (like OpenAI's pay-per-token). This setup is designed to **maximize bundled tool calls**, not minimize token usage.

---

## 🧠 Example

You have **500 monthly requests** and each request allows up to **25 tool calls**:

- **Normally:**
  `You say "hi" → AI replies "hi" = 1 request used.`

- **With CUTC:**
  `You say "hi" → AI replies → runs prompt → you say "add comments" → AI continues... (up to 25 calls)`
  = still **just 1 request used**, but you accomplished much more.

---

**Do more. Use fewer requests. Save your quota.**

**→ That's the power of CUTC.**

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

The installer includes built-in troubleshooting, but here are common solutions:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Rules don't apply** | Add YAML frontmatter to rules file (see Rule Configuration section) |
| **Permission denied** | Run as administrator (Windows) or with `sudo` (Linux/Mac) |
| **Python not found** | Install Python 3.6+ from [python.org](https://python.org) |
| **No terminal in chat** | Make sure you're in **Agent Mode** (Cursor) or **Cascade Mode** (Windsurf) |
| **IDE not detected** | Use `--ide cursor` or `--ide windsurf` flag |
| **Source files missing** | Make sure you have the complete CUTC package with `src/` folder |

## 🎯 Usage Tips

### For Cursor IDE:
1. **Configure rules**: Add YAML frontmatter or use `@.cursor/rules/cutc_rules.mdc` in chat
2. **Start with Agent Mode**: Make sure Cursor is in Agent Mode
3. **Let it finish**: Allow the AI to complete each task fully
4. **Use the prompt**: When you see `prompt (or file path):`, you can:
    - Type your next instruction (e.g., `"add comments"`)
    - Drag and drop a file into the terminal to paste its path.
5. **Chain commands**: Keep adding tasks to maximize your tool calls
6. **Type 'stop'**: End the loop when you're done

### For Windsurf IDE:
1. **Configure rules**: Add YAML frontmatter or use `@.windsurf/rules/cutc_rules.md` in chat
2. **Start with Cascade Mode**: Make sure Windsurf is in Cascade Mode
3. **Let it finish**: Allow Cascade to complete each task fully
4. **Use the prompt**: When you see `prompt (or file path):`, you can:
    - Type your next instruction (e.g., `"refactor this"`)
    - Drag and drop a file into the terminal to paste its path.
5. **Chain commands**: Keep adding tasks to maximize your tool calls
6. **Type 'stop'**: End the loop when you're done
